N Queens Solver

This script solves the N Queens problem, which involves placing
N non-attacking queens on an NÃ—N chessboard.
It takes a single argument, N, which must be an integer greater
than or equal to 4.
The script prints all possible solutions where each solution is
a list of positions of the queens.

Usage:
    python3 0-nqueens.py N

Arguments:
    N (int): The size of the chessboard and the number of queens.

Example:
    python3 0-nqueens.py 4
    [[0, 1], [1, 3], [2, 0], [3, 2]]
    [[0, 2], [1, 0], [2, 3], [3, 1]]
